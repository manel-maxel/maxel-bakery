        <p>A bakery is a food establishment that specializes in the preparation and sale of baked goods such as bread,
           cakes, pastries, and cookies. It serves as a welcoming space where customers can browse freshly made items, 
           place custom orders, and enjoy sweet and savory treats either on-site or for takeaway. Bakeries are popular 
           for their comforting atmosphere, artisan craftsmanship, and the sensory appeal of fresh-baked aromas. 
           Most bakeries display their products in glass cases or open shelves, often accompanied by labels listing ingredients, 
           prices, and dietary information.</p> 
           <p>Many also offer seasonal specials, catering services,
           or personalized cakes for events.</p>
